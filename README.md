# Bidirectional-counter

<p align="justify">In this code a counter automatically counts up or down and the direction of counting can be changed with a button press. A push-button is interfaced with the
microcontroller at the INT0 pin and External Interrupts are used to detect a button press and change the value of a variable. For more information on external interrupts, visit 
my External-interrupts repo <a href="https://github.com/asitha-navaratne/External-interrupts">here</a>.</p>
